# ClimaCast-DL
Pioneered deep learning on Jena Climate dataset (400K+ records) using LSTM, CNN &amp; DNN. Built robust time-series models via temporal windowing &amp; standardization. LSTM achieved lowest MAE. This project fuses scientific rigor with creative design to forecast complex climate patterns with real-world impact.
